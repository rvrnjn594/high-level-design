# How to Prepare for Success

Get an overview of some interview preperation guidelines and materials.

> We'll cover the following:
>
> - This course
> - Technical blogs
> - Ask why a system works
> - The right direction
> - Mock Interviews

Subsequent preparation is necessary to increase our odds of getting the job we apply for.

Depending on a candidate's seniority and proficieny, different candidates need differnt time for interview preperation.

## This course

This course helps readers learn or brush up on their system design skills.  
Carefully curated some traditional and fresh design problems to cover the substantial depth and breadth of the system design.

The following activities might expedite the preparation and add variety and further depth to a candidate's knowledge.

## Techinal blogs

> Many companies regularly publish the technical details of their significant work in the form of technical blogs.
>
> > The reason for such sharing is to excite the technical community about the fact that the company is solving hard problems. They also hope to motivate more people to join their company.
>
> Such public blogs can also help to advertise company products to B3B customers.
>
> Additionaly, such materials helps the company train potential future workers on their own time.

**Note:** There's a fine line between what can be held back by a company due to a competitive edge and what can be made public.

> We can study these blogs to get insights into what challenges or problems the company faced and what changes they made in the design to cope with these challanges.

**Note:** Staying informed about these innovations is important for professionals, and it's even more crucial for an applicant.

## Ask why a system works

By asking themselves the right questions, candidates can think through dense and ambiguous situations.

- Learn how popular applications work at a high level - eg: Instagram, Twitter, and so on.
- Start to understand and ask why some component was used instead of another - eg: Firebase vs SQL.
- Build serious side projects. Start with a simple product and then improve and refine it.
- Build a system from scratch, and familiar with all the processes and details of its construction.

## The right direction

System design deals with components at a higher level, and we need to avoid going into the trenches.

> We should focus less on mechanics and more on trade-offs.
>
> For example, discussing whether to use Room library instead of raw SQLite isn't helpful because Room library is a mere wrapper around SQLite. A better discussion might be about using traditional databases like MySQL or using NoSQL stores like MongoDB.  
>  (This single discussion will help us pinpoint trade-offs between the two.)

We should start with high-level stuff because the low-level details will automatically come up.

## Mock interviews

Mock interviews are a great way to prepare for system design interviews.

> **Note:** Since no mock interview can fully mimic an actual interview, it's a good idea to take real interview in companies. Once we've been through an interview or two, we'll be better able to evaluate what went right and what didn't.
