## Structure of the course

This course consists of forty chapters. These chapters can be segmented into four different sections given below.

1. **Introduction:** (comprised of five chapters.)  
   First chapter introduces the course and its key features.  
   Second chapter guides on how to prepare for the system design interview.  
   Third chapter talks about different types of abstractions.  
   Next, we discuss some indispensable non-functional characteristics that every large-scale system should have.  
   We wrap this chapter up with back-of-the-envelope calculations that enable us to estimate resources during our system design problems.
2. **Building blocks:** The "Building Blocks" chapter starts with an introductory lesson presenting sixteen different building blocks.  
   Each of these building blocks is explained in an independent chapter.
3. **Design Problems:** This section is the meat of the course and is carefully crafted from thirteen design problems.
4. **Epilogue:** The "Epilogue" section wraps up this course and is made up of three chapters.  
   First covers spectacular failures that show how, in the real-world, even a small mistake can bring down a large and successful application.  
   Such failures may be inevitable, but we highlight some measures to mitigate such failures.  
   We conclude the course with the concluding remarks chapter.

## Strengths of the course

Strengths:

- Building blocks
- Building blocks as design problems
- Incremental improvement to design
- Evaluating the design
- Solving the traditional problems with updated designs
- New design problems added
- Careful collection of design problems
- Contributions by experts from FAANG

Advantages:

- Modern approach to system design where we construct bigger artifacts using smaller building blocks.
- We'll treat each one of our building blocks as a stand-alone, mini design problems.
- Layer-by-layer design solution addresses added bottlenecks, designing simple and incremental solutions to complex system.
- Accountability of the provided design solution shows the performance of our design.
- This course is up to date with the latest industry demands.
- This course contains updates to decade-old system design courses.
- Each problem had its unique aspects in terms of problem-solving and designing.
- Learn from the best.
